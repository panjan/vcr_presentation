# What's VCR?

- stands for Video Cassette Recorder
- records your test suite's HTTP interactions and replays them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests

    Was using VCR in my previous job. I'd like to talk about how it helped us to a fast and stable continuous integration. But also about problems we had with it.
</aside>

# Example

``` ruby
require 'vcr'

VCR.configure do |c|
  c.cassette_library_dir = 'cassettes'
  c.hook_into :webmock
  c.configure_rspec_metadata!
  c.default_cassette_options = { :record => :new_episodes }
end

describe "VCR", :vcr do
  it 'records an http request' do
    5.times do
      puts Net::HTTP.get_response('localhost', '/', 4567).body
    end
  end
end
```

# Example Server

``` ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  sleep 1
  'Hello Ruby Stories!'
end
```

# Demo

<video src="vcr_demo.mov"></video>

<aside class="notes">
    1) bundle exec rspec test.rb
    2) run test again - fast and deterministic this time
    3) git status & explain ./cassettes
    4) test.rb: 5.times -> 6.times and run test again
</aside>

# How it works?

- checks HTTP method, URI, host, path, body and headers
- matchers for nondeterministic URIs

``` ruby
random_id_matcher = lambda do |actual, recorded|
  random_id_regex = %r{/uploads/.+}
  actual.parsed_uri.path.match random_id_regex
end
```

## 45 Minute CI Build
![slow build](slow_build.png)
- caused by a lot of integration tests
- ran on every PR
- 45 minutes to find out your code is broken
- every glitch of the staging server fails the build
- high load on the staging server
- hitting request limits

<aside class="notes">
    ...45 minute CI build which ran on every PR. This wasn't your ordinary Rails app, but an SDK which makes a lot of HTTP requests. With almost no mocked unit tests, development was sluggish and frustrating. Imagine you make a PR and after 45 minutes you learn the testing server was down and have to rerun the build. After another 45 minutes you find a small bug, fix it, rerun and so on.
</aside>

## Solution Attempt #1

- running unit tests with every PR and integration tests only once a day
- too many bugs getting to the develop branch
- we would learn about our bugs the next day (after switching context)

## The Solution

> With VCR, the same test suite finishes in under 5 minutes. That's 88% faster!
![fast build](fast_build.png)

## VCR Setup

- live tests [running every day](https://travis-ci.org/gooddata/gooddata-ruby/builds/520872126)

# Problems

> Making your tests run under VCR is not a walk in the park.

## Initial Investment

- VCRizing the tests took weeks (the dev was new to the project and language though)
- all blocks (not recorded by default)(https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-ruby/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb#L70)
- [parallelism](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-ruby/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb#L60)

<aside class="notes">
    well isolated tests needed
</aside>

## Development Overhead
- re-recording cassettes with almost every change
- recording cassettes could be automated
- writing matchers cannot be automated
- problems with recording from the middle of the test suite (e.g. [project cache](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-ruby/blob/master/spec/vcr_configurer.rb#L65-L71))
- where to store 390M of cassettes?

## Unit Tests?
- it's tempting not to write unit tests
- unit tests are needed for covering edge cases
- if it's hard to write tests, the code is probably too complex
- fortunately test coverage can be checked automatically (e.g. Coveralls)

# Summary
> VCR helped us make our 45 minute CI build run in under 5 minutes. The build is reliable and doesn't produce load on the staging server. Developers are happier and more productive because of the fast turn-around. There was a substantial initial investment and there is some development overhead (recording, writing matchers, troubleshooting). In our case, the benefits significantly outweigh the costs.
